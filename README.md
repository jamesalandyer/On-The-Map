# On-The-Map
An iOS app that allows you to share your location and linkedin profile with other students.

This is a networking app that allows Udacity students to post their name, location and a url to a website. The app lets you login with your Udacity login or your Facebook login. It then brings up a map of the last 100 student locations posted. You can then select each pin to bring up their name and url. If you click on it, safari opens with the url. You can also switch to list view which shows their name, location, and if you click on it safari opens with the url. You can also post your own location by clicking on the post button. It then asks for a location and geocodes the result to show on the next page. You are then prompted to enter your url and it also shows your location on the map. It then goes to post your location to the server. If you already posted, it asks if you want to overwrite it.
